# About Me

Hello there! I'm Bikash Jaiswal, an accomplished Software Engineer with a passion for implementing real-time products leveraging ML/AI models within cloud-based environments. With extensive experience working with the latest ML/AI frameworks and technologies, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, I strive to drive innovation and achieve high-impact results.

## Background
I hold a Master's degree in Applied Computer Science from Concordia University, Montreal, Canada, and I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Tezpur University, Assam, India. My educational journey has provided me with a strong foundation in computer science and allowed me to explore various aspects of software engineering and data science.

## Expertise
My technical skills include proficiency in languages such as Python, JavaScript, C++, and Rust. I am well-versed in utilizing developer tools like Git, PyCharm, Docker, gRPC, Jira, Jenkins, and Confluence to streamline development processes. Additionally, I have a deep understanding of Data Science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.

## Professional Experience
I am currently working as a Software Developer (R&D) at Cerence Inc, Montreal, Canada. In this role, I have successfully led the transition of proof-of-concept projects to production-ready conversational AI services. My dedication to optimizing services and my ability to collaborate with product management and engineering teams have been instrumental in delivering valuable insights and solutions to our customers.

During my time as a Research Assistant at the Machine Learning & Big Data Analytics Project, R&D Centre, Tezpur University, I focused on measuring, optimizing, and extracting insights from biological Big Data. I also had the opportunity to contribute to the development of automated ETL pipelines, RESTful APIs, and the deployment of machine learning models in the university's HPC.

## Projects

I am passionate about tackling challenging projects that allow me to explore the intersections of technology and real-world applications. Some of my notable projects include:

### Covid-19 Face Mask Detector

I developed an image classification model using Python, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Numpy, and Matplotlib to accurately identify individuals wearing masks or not. Through this project, I trained a custom CNN model that achieved an improved F1 score of 89%, while also addressing gender bias.

### Movie Success Forecaster

This project involved transforming the regression problem of predicting movie revenue into a multi-class classification challenge. By utilizing Numpy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and employing Neural Network and Ensemble Learning models, I significantly improved the prediction performance.

### SmartProp: Blockchain-based Decentralised Asset Management Application

Exploring the potential of Blockchain technology, I built a decentralized asset management application using ReactJS, CSS, HTML, and Solidity. Integrating the application with IPFS allowed me to address the storage limitations of Blockchain and enhance its usability.

## Interests

Apart from my work, I have a keen interest in keeping up with the latest advancements in technology, particularly in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Blockchain. I enjoy participating in hackathons and contributing to open-source projects to further expand my skills and knowledge.
